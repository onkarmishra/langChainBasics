So one thi ng that I think will help you to succeed and \\ndo well in this class and even help you to enjoy this cla ss more is if you form a study \\ngroup.  \\nSo start looking around where you' re sitting now or at the end of class today, mingle a \\nlittle bit and get to know your classmates. I strongly encourage you to form study groups \\nand sort of have a group of people to study with and have a group of your fellow students \\nto talk over these concepts with. You can also  post on the class news group if you want to \\nuse that to try to form a study group.  \\nBut some of the problems sets in this cla ss are reasonably difficult.
